issues such as vanishing gradients, and improving model generalization \
through advanced regularization techniques. You will also explore adaptive \
learning rate schedules and gradient descent variants, which are critical for \
fine-tuning your models and achieving optimal performance. \

on theoretical aspects, with dense mathematical formulations, or focus \
predominantly on computational algorithms, often at the expense of a solid \

The book \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Neural Network and Deep Learning with \
Mathematica\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] adopts a refreshingly code-centric \
approach, enabling you to solidify your understanding through hands-on \
practice. Nearly all the concepts introduced are accompanied by illustrative \
code examples, making the learning experience both practical and tangible. \
Even the figures in the first part are generated using these code examples, \
emphasizing the code-first methodology. To ensure accessibility and ease of \
understanding, the code examples are deliberately crafted in a simple format, \
prioritizing readability over efficiency and generality. In line with our \
instructional philosophy, each code example serves a dual purpose: not only \
does it demonstrate a specific deep learning concept, but it also \
simultaneously introduces and reinforces Mathematica programming techniques. \
Readers will learn how to leverage Mathematica to perform complex neural \
network and deep learning calculations, simulate data, and create visual \
representations of their findings.\
